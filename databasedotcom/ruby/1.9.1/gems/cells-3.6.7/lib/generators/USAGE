Description:
  Stubs out a new cell and its views. Pass the cell name, either
  CamelCased or under_scored, and a list of views as arguments.

  This generates a cell class in app/cells and view templates in
  app/cells/cell_name/ directory.

Examples:

  rails g cell ShoppingCart index

  This will create these cell assets:
    Cell:
      app/cells/shopping_cart_cell.rb
    Views:
      app/cells/shopping_cart/index.html.erb
    Test:
      test/cells/shopping_cart_cell_test.rb


  rails g cell main_menu display sort -e haml -t rspec

  This will create these cell assets:
    Cell:
      app/cells/main_menu_cell.rb
    Views:
      app/cells/main_menu/display.html.haml
      app/cells/main_menu/sort.html.haml
    Spec:
      spec/cells/main_menu_cell_spec.rb
